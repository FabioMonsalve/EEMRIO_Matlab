This code allows allocating the total Emissions of CO2 following the Producer Based Approach (PBA) and Consumer Based Approach (CBA) Criteria as explained in Monsalve, F., Zafrilla, J. E., & Cadarso, M.-?. (2016). "Where have all the funds gone?..." (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolecon.2016.06.006)

 It is necessary to download the following files 
 - https://dataverse.nl/api/access/datafile/199104 
      Note 1. This is a huge zip file including all the years
      Note 2. Excel format is xlsb; therefore if you are working in a MAC, 
              you should save as *.xlsx (OSX can't read .xlsb files)
 - https://joint-research-centre.ec.europa.eu/scientific-activities/economic-environmental-and-social-effects-globalisation_en

The files should be uncompressed and saved in the same folder where the code is allocated (saving in another folder will require changes in the set path preferences of Matlab).

The downloaded files cover all the years 2000-2014. The Code will only compute 2014, but easily you can change some parameters (as indicated in the code) to compute every other year. 

I hope you find this code useful in your Multiregional Input-Output analysis.
