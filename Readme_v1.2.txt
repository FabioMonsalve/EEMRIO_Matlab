This code allows to compute the 
footprint according to the Environmentally Extended Mutiregional Input-Output Methodology (EEMRIO) and realying on World Input Output Database release 2016 (https://www.rug.nl/ggdc/valuechain/wiod/wiod-2016-release). Employment as Persons Engaged, atributed to a bill of Final Demand, are allocated to countries/regions(44) and sectors (56).

It is necessary to download the following files
- https://dataverse.nl/api/access/datafile/199104
    Note.- This is a huge file including all the years
- https://ec.europa.eu/jrc/sites/default/files/co2em56.zip

The files should be uncompressed (if necessary) and saved in the same folder where the code is allocated (saving in another folder will require changes in the set path preferences of Matlab)

I hope you find this code useful in your Multiregional Input-Output analysis.
