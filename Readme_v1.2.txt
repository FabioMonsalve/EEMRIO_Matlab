This code allows to compute the Green House Gas Emissions (Co2 equivalent) according to the Environmentally Extended Mutiregional Input-Output Methodology (EEMRIO) and realying on World Input Output Database. Emissions, attributed to a bill of Final Demand, are allocated to countries/regions(41) and sectors (35).

It is necessary to download the following files from WIOD site.
- http://www.wiod.org/protected3/data13/update_sep12/wiot/wiot09_row_sep12.xlsx
- http://www.wiod.org/protected3/data13/AIR/AIR_may12.zip

The files should be uncompressed (if necessary) and saved in the same folder where the code is (saving in another folder will require changes in the set path preferences of Matlab)

I hope you find this code useful in your Multiregional Input-Output analysis.
